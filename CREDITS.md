Skeletor is based on Dave Gamache's [Skeleton V2.0.2](www.getskeleton.com). We are big fans of Skeleton and wanted to adapt it to our preferred workflow. This required converting it to Sass and adopting the [BEM syntax](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax) style class-names.

[scss-lint](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint) helps ensure that our Sass files have consistent formatting.

[Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) is our mixin library of choice. It helps keep our Sass free of browser prefixes.
